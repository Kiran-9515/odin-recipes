        <h4>How to make tomato rice step-by-step guide:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>This recipe is simple and quick. First up, rinse your basmati (or other long grain rice) under water until the water comes out clear. Now soak your rice in fresh water for 20 to 30 minutes, then drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Next up, pull out your trusty 3 litre pressure cooker and heat oil over a low flame until barely shimmering. You could use any neutral tasting oil. I have used sunflower oil.</li>
            <li>Next, add ⅓ cup chopped onions, ½ inch cinnamon stick, 2 green cardamom pods and 2 to 3 whole cloves.</li>
            <li>Stir and sauté until the onions are translucent.</li>
            <li> Now add 1 ½ teaspoons ginger garlic paste*, 6 to 7 curry leaves and 1 chopped green chili (½ teaspoon chopped chillies)</li>
            <li>Stir, then continue to sauté until the aroma of raw ginger-garlic goes away, about some seconds.</li>
            <li>Add ½ tablespoon of chopped mint leaves and ¼ cup chopped fresh coriander leaves (also known as cilantro).</li>
            <li>Stir and sauté for a minute.</li>
            <li>Now add in 1 cup of finely chopped tomatoes. This required about 3 medium tomatoes for me.</li>
            <li>
                Add the following list of ground spices:
                <ul>
                <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon red chili powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder or crushed black pepper*</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon coriander powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
                </ul>
            </li>  
            <li>Stir well to coat the tomatoes in the spices and sauté.</li>  
            <li>Cook until the tomatoes become soft and pulpy, and the oil begins to release from the sides. Stir often.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked rice and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Sauté the rice for a minute to allow it to soak in some of the toasted spice flavors.</li>
            <li>Next up, add 1¾ cup water. Add 2 cups water for more softer rice. For separate grains, add 1½ cup water.</li>
            <li>Season with salt to taste, then put the lid on.</li>
            <li>Once the pressure is released, remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
            <li>Serve in a bowl with crunchy papads (also known as papadums or appalams), plain curd or flavored raita, and a garnish of fresh coriander leaves for a bit of brightness. Enjoy!</li>
